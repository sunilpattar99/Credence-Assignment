Hello, 

Before anything else read here.

Below you can find the instructions how to run the application.
Step 1). After cloning from the git repository, run "npm init" as it will install all the dependencies for the executions.
Step 2). On the terminal run "npm start" the server will get online, 
         Note: This is configured for localhost only mainly (localhost:3000), if you want you can change the configuration.
Step 3). You might notice ".ejs" files in the views directory, they are additional, if you want to view api's in text version please
         follow the comments in "index.js" file.

Please refer "api.docx" and "MovieApi.mp4" video for the endpoint info.


Thankyou.!!!
